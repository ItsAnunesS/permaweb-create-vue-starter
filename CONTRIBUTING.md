## Getting started

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

In case of encountering any issues, [search for existing issues](https://github.com/ItsAnunesS/permaweb-create-vue-starter/issues) before opening a new one. If no related issue exists, create a new one using the relevant [issue form](https://github.com/ItsAnunesS/permaweb-create-vue-starter/issues/new).

#### Solve an issue

Examine our [existing issues](https://github.com/ItsAnunesS/permaweb-create-vue-starter/issues) to identify one that piques your interest.

## Make Changes


### Commit your update

Commit the changes when you are satisfied with them. Remember to conduct a self-review to accelerate the review process:zap:.

#### Self-review

Conduct a self-review of your PR before submitting it for review by others.

Ensure the following when making content changes:

- [ ] Make sure to concentrate on a single goal in each PR to ensure its success and to maintain a well-structured codebase.
- [ ] Ensure that your PR and commits are written in English and have clear and concise titles and descriptions.
- [ ] Resolve any failing checks, errors, or warnings in your PR until all are passing.
- [ ] Create separate PRs/Commits for each folder when making changes. For example, if you make changes in JavaScript and TypeScript, create a separate PR for each rather than combining them into a single PR.

### Pull Request

When you have completed the changes, submit a pull request (PR) for review.
